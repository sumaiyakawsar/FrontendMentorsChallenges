## Overview
 Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
